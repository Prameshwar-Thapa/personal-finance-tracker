# Personal Finance Tracker - Local Development Guide

*I chose this personal finance management application to learn cloud engineering concepts like containerization, persistent storage, and Kubernetes deployments. This guide will help you get it running locally to understand the infrastructure requirements!*

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes to Running!)

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.9+ (check with `python3 --version`)
- That's it! Everything else gets installed automatically

### Let's Get Started!
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the project (if you just downloaded it)
cd personal-finance-tracker

# 2. Create a virtual environment (keeps things clean)
python3 -m venv venv

# 3. Activate it (you'll see (venv) in your terminal)
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install everything we need
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Create folders for file uploads
mkdir -p static/uploads/receipts static/css static/js

# 6. Start the app!
python run.py
```

** That's it! Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000**

You should see the Personal Finance Tracker homepage. Create an account and start exploring!

###  No Database Setup Required!
**Important**: You don't need to install or configure any database! Here's why:
- **SQLite comes with Python** - No separate installation needed
- **Database auto-creates** - The `finance.db` file appears automatically on first run
- **Tables auto-generate** - All database structure is created by the application
- **Zero configuration** - Just run the app and it works!

**Local vs Cloud Database:**
- **Local (SQLite)**: File-based, perfect for development, zero setup
- **Cloud (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Managed service, high availability, requires configuration

This demonstrates the **infrastructure difference** between local development and production cloud deployment!

### When You're Done
```bash
# Stop the app by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal
# Then deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

## Understanding the Application (Cloud Engineering Perspective)

### The Application Stack
I'm using this application to demonstrate cloud infrastructure concepts:

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) - Stateless application layer
- **Database**: SQLite (local) / PostgreSQL (production) - Persistent data storage
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - Static assets for CDN
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (local) / S3 (cloud) - Object storage patterns
- **Authentication**: Session-based - Stateful vs stateless considerations

### Why This Application for Cloud Learning?
- **Persistent Storage**: Demonstrates database and file storage requirements
- **Stateful Data**: Shows challenges of data persistence in containers
- **Multi-tier Architecture**: Frontend, backend, database separation
- **File Uploads**: Object storage and volume mounting concepts
- **User Sessions**: State management in distributed systems

## üí° How It Works (Infrastructure Perspective)

### The Architecture Flow
```
User Browser ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí Application Pods ‚Üí Database
                            ‚Üí Object Storage (files)
```

### Local vs Cloud Infrastructure
**Local Setup:**
- Single server running everything
- SQLite file-based database
- Local file system storage
- No load balancing

**Cloud Setup (What I'm Learning):**
- Multiple application instances
- Managed database service
- Object storage (S3)
- Load balancers and auto-scaling

## üîç Exploring Infrastructure Requirements

### First Time Setup
1. **Create an Account**: Test user authentication flow
2. **Add Some Categories**: Understand data relationships
3. **Add Transactions**: See database operations
4. **Upload a Receipt**: Test file storage requirements
5. **Check the Dashboard**: Observe data aggregation

### Infrastructure Patterns to Observe
- **Database Connections**: How the app connects to data storage
- **File Handling**: Where uploaded files are stored
- **Session Management**: How user state is maintained
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU patterns
- **Data Persistence**: What happens when you restart the app

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting (Infrastructure Issues)

### "Port 5000 is already in use"
```bash
# Find what's using the port (service discovery concept)
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process (container restart simulation)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port (load balancer port mapping)
# Change: app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, debug=True)
```

### "Can't find module xyz"
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated (container isolation)
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall requirements (dependency management)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Permission denied" for uploads
```bash
# Make sure the upload directory exists (persistent volume setup)
mkdir -p static/uploads/receipts
chmod 755 static/uploads/receipts
```

### App won't stop with Ctrl+C
```bash
# Force kill it (pod termination)
ps aux | grep "python run.py"
kill -9 <PID>
```

## üìä Understanding Data Persistence

### What Gets Stored (Persistent Volume Requirements)
- **Database**: User accounts, transactions, categories
- **Files**: Receipt images in organized folders
- **Sessions**: User authentication state
- **Logs**: Application and error logs

### Storage Patterns
```
personal-finance-tracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ finance.db                     # Database file (needs persistent volume)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/uploads/receipts/        # File uploads (needs object storage)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1/                         # User-specific folders
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/                          # Dependencies (ephemeral)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [application files]            # Code (ephemeral)
```
