# My Personal Finance Tracker - Local Development Guide

*Hi! I'm Prameshwar, and I built this personal finance application to demonstrate my cloud engineering skills. This guide will help you run it locally and understand the infrastructure concepts I've implemented.*

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes to Running!)

I designed this to be super easy to get started - no complex database setup required!

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.9+ (check with `python3 --version`)
- That's it! I've made everything else automatic

### Let's Get Started!
```bash
# 1. Navigate to my project
cd personal-finance-tracker

# 2. Create a virtual environment (I always do this to keep things clean)
python3 -m venv venv

# 3. Activate it (you'll see (venv) in your terminal)
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install all the dependencies I've specified
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Create folders for file uploads (mimics cloud storage structure)
mkdir -p static/uploads/receipts static/css static/js

# 6. Start my application!
python run.py
```

**That's it! Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000**

## üéØ Why I Built This Application

I chose to build a personal finance tracker because it demonstrates several key cloud engineering concepts:

- **Persistent Storage**: User data and file uploads need to survive container restarts
- **Multi-tier Architecture**: Separate frontend, backend, and database layers
- **Stateful vs Stateless**: Understanding when and how to manage state
- **File Storage Patterns**: Local filesystem vs cloud object storage
- **Database Design**: Relational data with proper migrations

### No Database Setup Required!
**Here's what I love about my local setup:**
- **SQLite comes with Python** - No separate installation needed
- **Database auto-creates** - The `finance.db` file appears automatically on first run
- **Tables auto-generate** - All database structure is created by my application
- **Zero configuration** - Just run the app and it works!

**This demonstrates the infrastructure difference I'm learning:**
- **Local (SQLite)**: File-based, perfect for development, zero setup
- **Cloud (PostgreSQL)**: Managed service, high availability, requires proper configuration

## üèóÔ∏è Understanding My Application Architecture

### The Stack I Chose
I selected each technology for specific learning reasons:

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) - Lightweight, perfect for learning containerization
- **Database**: SQLite (local) / PostgreSQL (production) - Shows persistence patterns
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - Static assets for CDN learning
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (local) / S3 (cloud) - Object storage concepts
- **Authentication**: Session-based - State management in distributed systems

### My Architecture Flow
```
User Browser ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí Application Pods ‚Üí Database
                            ‚Üí Object Storage (files)
```

This simple flow teaches me about:
- Service discovery and communication
- Load balancing strategies
- Data persistence patterns
- Stateless application design

## üí° What I Learned Building This

### Infrastructure Patterns I Implemented
1. **Create an Account**: Test my user authentication flow
2. **Add Some Categories**: Understand my data relationships
3. **Add Transactions**: See my database operations in action
4. **Upload a Receipt**: Test my file storage requirements
5. **Check the Dashboard**: Observe my data aggregation logic

### Local vs Cloud Infrastructure Concepts
**My Local Setup:**
- Single server running everything
- SQLite file-based database
- Local file system storage
- No load balancing needed

**My Cloud Setup (What I'm Targeting):**
- Multiple application instances for high availability
- Managed database service (RDS/Cloud SQL)
- Object storage (S3/GCS) for files
- Load balancers and auto-scaling groups

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting My Application

### "Port 5000 is already in use"
```bash
# Find what's using the port (service discovery concept)
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process (simulates container restart)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port (load balancer port mapping concept)
# I can modify: app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, debug=True)
```

### "Can't find module xyz"
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated (container isolation)
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall my requirements (dependency management)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Permission denied" for uploads
```bash
# Make sure my upload directory exists (persistent volume setup)
mkdir -p static/uploads/receipts
chmod 755 static/uploads/receipts
```

## üìä My Data Persistence Strategy

### What Gets Stored (My Persistent Volume Requirements)
- **Database**: User accounts, transactions, categories
- **Files**: Receipt images in organized folders
- **Sessions**: User authentication state
- **Logs**: Application and error logs (for monitoring)

### My Storage Patterns
```
personal-finance-tracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ finance.db                     # Database file (needs persistent volume)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/uploads/receipts/        # File uploads (needs object storage)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1/                         # User-specific folders
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/                          # Dependencies (ephemeral)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [application files]            # Code (ephemeral in containers)
```

### My Cloud Storage Mapping Strategy
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL for managed, scalable database
- **File Uploads**: S3 for object storage with CDN integration
- **Application Code**: Container images in ECR/Docker Hub
- **Configuration**: Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
