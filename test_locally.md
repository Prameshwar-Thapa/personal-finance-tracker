# Testing Personal Finance Tracker Locally (Without Docker)

This guide will help you set up and test the Personal Finance Tracker application on your local machine without using Docker.

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.9+** (Check with: `python --version` or `python3 --version`)
- **SQLite** (comes with Python - no separate installation needed)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **Virtual environment support** (venv - comes with Python)

### Install System Dependencies

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

#### On macOS:
```bash
# Python 3 usually comes pre-installed, but you can install via Homebrew if needed
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python (if needed)
brew install python
```

#### On Windows:
1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) (make sure to check "Add Python to PATH")
2. Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /home/prameshwar/Desktop/personal-finance-tracker
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify activation (you should see (venv) in your prompt)
which python  # Should point to venv/bin/python
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all required packages (including email-validator)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you get an email-validator error, install it separately:
pip install email-validator

# Verify installation
pip list | grep -E "(Flask|email|wtforms)"
```

### Step 4: Setup Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# The .env file is already configured for SQLite by default
# DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///finance.db
```

### Step 5: Create Required Directories
```bash
# Create upload directories
mkdir -p static/uploads/receipts
mkdir -p static/css
mkdir -p static/js

# Set proper permissions (Linux/macOS)
chmod 755 static/uploads/receipts
```

### Step 6: Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Set Flask environment variables
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export FLASK_ENV=development

# On Windows use:
# set FLASK_APP=run.py
# set FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Step 7: Run the Application
```bash
# Direct Python execution (Recommended)
python run.py

# Alternative: Using Flask command
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

### Expected Output
When you run `python run.py`, you should see:
```
Database tables created successfully!
Starting Personal Finance Tracker...
Access the application at: http://localhost:5000
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Amount**: `45.50`
   - **Description**: `Grocery Shopping`
   - **Type**: Select `Expense`
   - **Category**: Select `Food & Dining`
   - **Date**: Use current date
   - **Receipt**: Upload a test image (JPG/PNG) if available
   - **Notes**: `Weekly groceries`
3. Click "Add Transaction"

#### Add More Test Transactions
Add a few more transactions to see the dashboard populate:
- Coffee: $5.50 (Expense, Food & Dining)
- Gas: $40.00 (Expense, Transportation)
- Freelance: $300.00 (Income, Other)

### Step 5: Test Dashboard Features
1. Navigate back to "Dashboard"
2. Verify the financial summary shows:
   - **Monthly Income**: Should show your income transactions
   - **Monthly Expenses**: Should show your expense transactions
   - **Monthly Balance**: Should show income minus expenses
   - **Total Balance**: Should show overall balance
3. Check that recent transactions appear in the list
4. Verify category breakdown shows expenses by category

### Step 6: Test Transactions Page
1. Click "Transactions" in the navigation
2. Verify all your transactions are listed
3. Check that:
   - Dates are displayed correctly
   - Categories show with color indicators
   - Income shows in green, expenses in red
   - Receipt icons appear for transactions with uploads

### Step 7: Test File Upload (Optional)
1. Create a small test image file (or use any JPG/PNG)
2. Add a new transaction with receipt upload
3. Verify the file is saved by checking:
   ```bash
   ls -la static/uploads/receipts/
   ```
4. You should see your uploaded file with a unique name

### Step 8: Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test health check (should work without login)
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX.XXXXXX","version":"1.0.0"}
```

## üîç SQLite Database Testing

### Step 1: Verify Database Creation
```bash
# Check if database file was created
ls -la finance.db

# Should show a file with size > 0 bytes
```

### Step 2: Inspect Database Directly
```bash
# Install SQLite command-line tool (if not already installed)
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install sqlite3

# macOS (usually pre-installed):
# brew install sqlite3

# Access the database
sqlite3 finance.db
```

### Step 3: Run Database Queries
In the SQLite prompt, run these commands:
```sql
-- List all tables
.tables

-- Expected output: categories  transactions  users

-- View table structures
.schema users
.schema transactions
.schema categories

-- Check your user account
SELECT id, username, email, created_at FROM users;

-- Check default categories
SELECT id, name, color, user_id FROM categories;

-- Check your transactions
SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.description,
    t.amount,
    t.transaction_type,
    t.date,
    c.name as category_name
FROM transactions t
LEFT JOIN categories c ON t.category_id = c.id
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;

-- Get financial summary
SELECT 
    transaction_type,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM transactions 
GROUP BY transaction_type;

-- Exit SQLite
.quit
```

### Step 4: Test Database Persistence
```bash
# Stop the application (Ctrl+C in the terminal running the app)

# Restart the application
python run.py

# Login again - your data should still be there
# Navigate to dashboard - transactions should persist
```

### Step 5: Populate Test Data (Optional)
```bash
# Run the test data script to add sample transactions
python test_sqlite_data.py

# This will create:
# - Sample income and expense transactions
# - Various categories with transactions
# - Realistic financial data for testing
```
